<h2 style="font-size:2em;"> The relaxometry hype cycle</h2>

<p  style="font-size:18p;">A recap of my ISMRM educational talk about MRI relaxometry, given at the 2022 educational sessions. Read on for a history of the field and some exciting 2023 announcements!</p>

<p style="font-size:18p;">In 2022 I was invited by the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine to give an educational talk about relaxometry entitled “Relaxometry: Where, Why & How It Is & Is Not Used.”</p>

<p style="font-size:18p;">Back when I accepted I told myself I really need to change the title, as it is too broad and has too many ampersands. However, as with most reminders I have set since 2020, this one is still on my to-do list, and the ISMRM conference proceedings wait for no one.</p>
